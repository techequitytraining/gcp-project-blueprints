# Analysis of Platform Capabilities

Here is a point-by-point verification of the features you listed, along with my findings from the code:

## Core Platform Features

*   **Platform can be deployed in a SaaS mode or for a single organisation**
    *   **Status:** Implemented, but primarily for a single organization.
    *   **Details:** The architecture is centered around a single GCP organization, as indicated by the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GCP_ORGANIZATION` environment variable. While adaptable, its core design is not multi-tenant SaaS.

*   **Enable and disable billing (need for credits to perform deployments)**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** Admins can globally enable or disable the credit system. If enabled, deployments require credits.

*   **GDPR support to allow users to delete their data**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** Users have the option to delete their own accounts, which is handled by the backend.

*   **Users can selectively enable billing or deployment email notifications**
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented.
    *   **Details:** The platform can send email notifications for deployment events. However, this is a global setting controlled by the admin. Individual users cannot opt-in or opt-out of these notifications.

*   **The platform deploys terraform resources from a private, protected git repo**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** The system is designed to fetch Terraform modules from a Git repository and supports private repositories via a GitHub token.

*   **The credit cost can be defined as a configuration for each module**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** A fixed deployment cost can be assigned to each module. The user's credit balance is debited when the module successfully deploys.

*   **The credit cost are deducted based on GCP resource consumption**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** The platform calculates costs based on the actual resources deployed and their usage, and these costs are debited from the user's credit balance.

*   **The module author can include a description that is redered on the module tooltip**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** Module metadata, including descriptions, is fetched from the Git repository and displayed in the UI.

*   **The state of a deployment can be tracked from the platform from QUEUED, to WORKKING and SUCCESS or FAILURE**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** The UI provides real-time status updates for deployments, including logs.

*   **Successful or failed deployments can be updated**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** Existing deployments can be updated through the platform.

*   **All deployment can be deleted**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** Users can delete their deployments, which will trigger a process to destroy the created resources.

*   **Users can search for modules, filter for relevance**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** The UI includes a search functionality to find modules.

*   **User accounts can be blocked from using the platform**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** Admins can deactivate a user's account, effectively blocking them from using the platform.

*   **Admin can send messages to one or all users**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Details:** There is an admin feature to send messages to users.

## Billing Features

*   **Signup credits can be awarded to new users**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Referral credits can be awarded to anyone who refers a new user**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Alerts can be sent when credits fall below low credit threshold**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Billing is diabled for projects when credits run out**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **A price can be set for credits in USD**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Credits can be purchased using stripe**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Project billing is calculated at a customizable refresh interval**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Free credits can be assigned to all users**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Credits can be assigned to a specific user**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Users and admins can view and export GCP project costs to csv files**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Admins can view and export revenue data to csv files**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

*   **Admins and users can view monthly invoice data**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.

## Additional Platform Capabilities

*   **Role-Based Access within Deployments:** You can assign `trusted_users` and `owner_users` to specific deployments, allowing for fine-grained control over who can access and manage deployed resources.
*   **Global and Tiered Variables:** Admins can set global variables that apply to all deployments. The system uses a clear precedence (user variables > module variables > global variables) to provide both flexibility and administrative control.
*   **Built-in Support System:** The platform includes a simple support request form for users to contact admins.
*   **Customizable UI:** The user interface is built with theming in mind, allowing for easy customization to match your organization's branding.
